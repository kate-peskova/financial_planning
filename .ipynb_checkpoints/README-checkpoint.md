Financial planning with Alpaca APIs, Monte Carlo Stimulation, and Python

## Financial Planner

This project analyzes a potential customer’s personal finance health using a set of programming and analytical tools such as Python Pandas, Alpaca APIs and Monte Carlo simulations.

* Part 1. Pulling real time data from APIs and plotting it.

The project consists of two parts. In the part one we are pulling real life stock data from Alpaca APIs and real time crypto currencies prices and applying them to our customer’s assets to calculate their balance. We then add the customer household’s monthly income and plot the data. Once calculations are complete, we write a small Python code to verify whether current customer’s assets are enough to fulfill their emergency reserve.

* Part 2. Using Monte Carlo simulations to forecast future return of today's investment

In the second part of the project, we are using Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the potential return of a customer’s initial lump sum investment. The goal of the second part projections is to estimate whether the customer will be able to retire in thirty, ten or five years.
